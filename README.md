A way to make fully automated light for the modelrailroad.
Based on a normal Arduino UNO. 
Using the WS2811 chips and WS2812b leds.
Starting with use of the Fastled library.
The idea is to make three 'lines' of leds. 
each 64 leds or seperate ws2811. 
So a total of 192 leds all individual adressed by programs run on the arduino. 
The programs make all kind of light effects like morning-day-evening-night. 
Synchronized with lights in houses buildings streetlights and so on. 
Further effects like fire, welding, lightning, nothren light and what ever i can think of.
Using the project must be very simple just hook up the leds, ws2811 in the correct sequence. 
But all kind of extra programmable parameters will be supplied. 
Will be great.
Started this end of 2017, readyaround december 2018.
